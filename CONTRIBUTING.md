## Setting up Eclipse

When opening Eclipse you will most likely be prompted to select a workspace, navigate to your cloned repository and select the `src` folder as your workspace.

If you are not prompted, go to `File -> Switch Workspace -> Other...`

If all has gone well, you should see `robo.race` and `robo.race.tests` projects in the Package Explorer.
